    "Melbourne, where I am currently staying, is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second most populous city in Australia and Oceania. It has a population of 5 million (19% of the population of Australia). At the city's centre is the modern Federation Square development, with plazas, bars, and restaurants by the Yarra River. So, it is definitely one of the best places to start up a new business in Australia."

This food is one of the best foods among Australians and there are many sushi restaurants around the Australia, and particularly Victoria state."
